<h2>“I don’t dream at night, I dream at day, I dream all day; 
    I’m dreaming for a living.” – Steven Spielberg</h2>

<p>Steven Spielberg is one of the most well known directrors, producers
    and screen writers of this era and many of his movies are logged into our
    collective pop-culture psyche. His work has been around the world for more 
    than 40 years and is viewed as one of the most popular directors and 
    producers in film history. Spielberg's big breakthrough as a director 
    came in 1977 with "Close Encounters of the Third Kind", then he directed 
    classics like "Jurassic Park", "Hook", "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" and the 
    "Indiana Jones" Franchise.</p>

<p>Director, filmmaker and producer Steven Spielberg was born on December 18, 1946,
    in Cincinnati, Ohio. Spielberg moved several times but everything changed
    when he spent part of his youth in Phoenix, Arizona. While living in Phoenix,
    when Spielberg was only 13-years-old, decided to film a war film he titled 
    "Escape to Nowhere" using his teenage friends as actors and he won a prize 
    for his 40 minutes war film. The win motivated him to continue to make 15 more
    amateur 8mm films. When he was 16-years-old, Spielberg wrote and directed his 
    first independent film, a 140-minute science fiction adventure called Firelight, 
    which would later inspire Close Encounters. He made the film with $500 he 
    borrowed from his dad, and was shown in a local cinema for one evening, which 
    earned back its cost. After attending Arcadia High School in Phoenix for 
    three years, his family next moved to Saratoga, California where he later 
    graduated from Saratoga High School in 1965.</p>

<p>Spielberg would become one of the youngest television directors for 
   Universal in the late 1960s. Along with his three Oscar wins (Schindler's List 
   not only Best Director but also Best Picture and Saving Private Ryan won
   Best Director), he has received many other honors. He received the 
   Irving G. Thalberg Memorial. Award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts 
   and Sciences in 1986. In 2004, Spielberg received the Directors Guild of 
   America Lifetime Achievement Award and the French Legion of Honor in 
   recognition of his work. The following year, he was inducted into the Science 
   Fiction Hall of Fame.</p>

<p>The next movie for 2022 year will be about his childhood in Phoenix, Arizona. 
    This movie will center on a young child and teen living in Phoenix during 
    the late 1950s and early '60s and will be covering several time periods. that 
    is the same time Steven Spielberg himself was living in the Valley.</p>
<p>The character's name is not Steven. But the story, which Spielberg co-wrote
    with Tony Kushner, sounds like there are definite hints of the young age 
    of Steven. 
</p>
<p>This movie is set to be released by the year 2022</p>
